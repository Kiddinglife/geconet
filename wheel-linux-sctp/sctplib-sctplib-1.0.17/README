---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that you must have glib version 1.2 and/or 2.0 installed in order for
the compilation to succeed! GLIB is a generic C-library for things like lists,
arrays, timers etc. Should you not have it installed, you can obtain it for most
OS's from ftp://www.gtk.org/pub/gtk/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just use
prompt> tar xvfz sctplib-1.0.14-XYZ.tar.gz
and you get a new directory 
sctplib-1.0.14-XYZ

cd into that and type
./configure
or 
./configure --help


After that use make (or gmake under FreeBSD) to compile the
library! Happy SCTPing! :-)

It contains a number of files that are shortly described hereafter:
AUTHORS  :    People who have produced this code.
COPYING  :    The license to be applied for using/compiling/distributing 
              this code. 
INSTALL  :    Basic installation notes.
NEWS     :    Changes from release to release.
README   :    This file 
TODO     :    A more or less complete list of missing features/known
              problems, etc.
sctplib  :    A directory containig the files belonging to the SCTP
              implementation. This will contain the actual executable
              called <sctp>.
sctplib/sctp : contains the files for the actual library, which will be named
               libsctp.a. Also contains the necessary include file sctp.h

sctplib/manual :   A subdirectory containing some tex files and a PDF manual,
                describing general implementation features, the API, and

                a new manual after release of sctplib-1.0.14 !

sctplib/docs: This subdirectory will contain documentation after the build
    process, that has been automatically derived from the source code.
