Abstract 
    
    SCTP [RFC2960] supports IP multihoming at the transport layer. SCTP
    allows an association to span multiple local and peer IP addresses,
    and allows the application to dynamically change the primary
    destination during an active association. We present a problem in the
    current SCTP specification that results in unnecessary retransmissions
    and "TCP-unfriendly" growth of the sender's congestion window during
    certain changeover conditions. We present the problem and propose an
    algorithm called the Split Fast Retransmit Changeover Aware Congestion
    Control algorithm (SFR-CACC) as a solution. We recommend the addition
    of SFR-CACC to the SCTP specification [RFC2960].

1. Introduction 
     
    In an SCTP [RFC2960] association, the sender transmits data to its
    peer's primary destination address. SCTP provides for
    application-initiated changeovers so that the sending application can
    move the outgoing traffic to another path by changing the sender's
    primary destination address. We uncovered a problem in the
    current SCTP specification that results in unnecessary retransmissions
    and "TCP-unfriendly" growth of the sender's congestion window under
    certain changeover conditions. We present the problem and propose an
    algorithm called the Split Fast Retransmit Changeover Aware Congestion
    Control (SFR-CACC) algorithm as a solution. We recommend the addition
    of the SFR-CACC algorithm to the SCTP specification [RFC2960].
     
   
    2. Congestion Window Overgrowth: Problem Description

    We present a specific example which illustrates the congestion window
    overgrowth problem.

    2.1 Example Description:

    Consider the architecture shown below:

       ______                  _________                 ______
      |      |	              /         \               |      |
      |      |A1 <============== Path 1 ============> B1|      |
      |      |<------------->|           |<------------>|      |
      | Host |               |  Network  |              | Host |
      |  A   |               |           |              |  B   |
      |      |<------------->|           |<------------>|      |
      |      |A2 <============== Path 2 ============> B2|      |
      |      |                \_________/               |      |
       ------                                            ------

                      Fig 1: Example Architecture

     SCTP endpoints A and B have an association between them. Both
     endpoints are multihomed, A with network interfaces A1 and A2, and B
     with interfaces B1 and B2. More precisely, A1, A2, B1 and B2 are IP
     addresses associated with link layer interfaces.  Here we assume only
     one address per interface, so address and interface are used
     interchangeably.

     All four addresses are bound to the SCTP association.  For one of
     several possible reasons (e.g., path diversity, policy based routing,
     load balancing), we assume in this example that the data traffic from
     A to B1 is routed through A1, and from A to B2 is routed through A2.

     Let C1 be the cwnd at A for destination B1, and C2 be the cwnd at A
     for destination B2. C1 and C2 are denoted in terms of MTUs, not
     bytes.

     Consider the following sequence of events:
     
     1) The sender (host A) initially sends data to the receiver (host B)
        using primary destination address B1. This setting causes packets
        to leave through A1. Assume these packets leave the
        transport/network layers, and get buffered at A's link layer A1,
        whereupon they get transmitted according to the channel's
        availability. We refer to these TSNs (that is, packets) the first
        group of TSNs.
	
     2) Assume as the first group of TSNs is being transmitted through A1,
        that the sender's application changes the primary destination to
        B2, thereby causing any new data from the sender to be sent to
        B2. In the example, we assume C2 = 2 at the moment of changeover
        and new TSNs (second group of TSNs) are now transmitted to the new
        primary, B2.  This new primary destination causes new TSNs to
        leave the sender through A2. Concurrently, the packets buffered
        earlier at A1 are still being transmitted.  Previous packets sent
        through A1, and the packets sent through A2, can arrive at the
        receiver B in an interleaved fashion on interfaces B1 and B2,
        respectively. This reordering is introduced as a result of
        changeover.
	
     3) The receiver starts reporting gaps as soon as it notices
        reordering. If the receiver communicates four missing reports to
        the sender before all original transmissions of the first group
        have been acked, the sender will start retransmitting the unacked
        TSNs on path 2.

     4) The SACKs for the original transmission of the first group of TSNs
        reach A on A1. Since the sender cannot distinguish between SACKs
        generated by transmissions from SACKs generated by
        retransmissions, the SACKs now received by A on A1 end up acking
        the retransmissions of the first group of TSNs, incorrectly
        crediting C2 instead of C1. This behaviour whereby SACKs for
        original transmissions incorrectly ack retransmissions continues
        until all original transmissions of the first group are
        retransmitted to B2. Thus, the SACKs from the original
        transmissions cause C2 to grow (possibly drastically) from wrong
        interpretation of the feedback.


     2.2 Discussion

     Our preliminary investigation shows that the problem occurs for a

Iyengar et al.                                                  [Page 3]

draft-iyengar-sctp-cacc-03.txt                             November 2005

     range of {end-to-end delay, end-to-end available bandwidth, MTU}
     settings. [IC+03] gives a more detailed description and analysis of
     the problem. From the general model developed in [IC+03], we have
     found that whenever a changeover is made to a higher quality path
     (i.e., lower end-to-end delay, higher end-to-end available bandwidth
     path), there is a likelihood of TCP-unfriendly cwnd growth and
     unnecessary retransmissions. We also note that the bigger the quality
     improvement that the new path provides, the larger the TCP-unfriendly
     growth and number of false retransmissions will be.

     The congestion window overgrowth (i.e., TCP-unfriendly congestion
     window growth) problem exists even if buffering of the first group
     occurs not at the sender's link layer, but in a router along the path
     (in the example architecture, path 1). In essence, the transport
     layers at the endpoints can be thought of as the sending and
     receiving entities, and the buffering could potentially be
     distributed anywhere along the end-to-end path.


3. Solution to the Problem: The SFR-CACC Algorithm
    
    The problem of TCP-unfriendly cwnd growth occurs due to incorrect fast
    retransmissions. These incorrect retransmissions occur because the
    congestion control algorithm at the sender is unaware of the
    occurrence of a changeover, and is hence unable to identify reordering
    introduced due to changeover. In [IC+03], we propose the Changeover
    Aware Congestion Control algorithms (CACC) - the Conservative CACC
    algorithm (C-CACC), and the Split Fast Retransmit CACC algorithm
    (SFR-CACC), which curb the TCP-unfriendly cwnd growth by avoiding
    these unnecessary fast retransmissions. Of the three algorithms,
    C-CACC has the disadvantage that in the face of loss, a lot of TSNs
    could potentially have to wait for an RTO when they could have been
    fast retransmitted. SFR-CACC alleviates this disadvantage.

    The key idea in SFR-CACC is to maintain state at the sender on a
    per-destination basis when a changeover happens. On the receipt of a
    SACK, the sender uses this state to selectively increase the missing
    report count for TSNs in the retransmission list. In SFR-CACC, we
    further make the following observation: the reordering observed during
    changeover happens because TSNs which are supposed to reach the
    receiver in-sequence end up reaching the receiver in concurrent
    groups, in-sequence within each group. With this observation, we
    reason that the Fast Retransmit algorithm can be applied independently
    within each group. That is, on the receipt of a SACK, if we can
    estimate the TSN(s) that causes this SACK to be sent from the
    receiver, we can use the SACK to increment missing report counts
    within the causative TSN(s)'s group. Our estimate is conservative, if
    a SACK could have been caused by TSNs in multiple groups, this SACK
    will be used to increment missing report counts only for TSNs sent to
    the current primary destination, if any.  In the case where multiple
    changeovers cycle back to a destination while the CHANGEOVER_ACTIVE is
    still set, CYCLING_CHANGEOVER is set to indicate a double switch to
    the destination. The CYCLING_CHANGEOVER flag is used to mark TSNs in
    only the latest group sent to the current primary destination, thus

Iyengar et al.                                                  [Page 4]

draft-iyengar-sctp-cacc-03.txt                             November 2005

    preventing incorrect marking of TSNs in any other changeover
    range. SFR-CACC also enables Fast Retransmit for TSNs which could have
    timed out on some destination, but were retransmitted on the current
    primary destination after the latest changeover to the current primary
    destination. We now present the SFR-CACC algorithm in its current
    simplified form, also described in [IS+04,IAS05].

    3.1 Variables Introduced

    In SFR-CACC, four variables are introduced:

    1) CHANGEOVER_ACTIVE - a flag which indicates the occurrence of
       a changeover.
    2) next_tsn_at_change -  an unsigned integer, which stores the next
       TSN to be used by the sender, at the moment of changeover.
    3) highest_tsn_in_sack_for_dest - an unsigned integer per destination,
       which stores the highest TSN acked by the current SACK for each
       destination.
    4) cacc_saw_newack - a temporary flag per destination, which is used
       during the processing of a SACK to estimate the causative TSN(s)'s
       group.


    3.2 The SFR-CACC Algorithm

    The following algorithm requires that after a timeout retransmission,
    the retransmitted TSN MUST be rendered ineligible for further fast
    retransmission.

    Upon receipt of a request to change the primary destination
    address, the sender MUST do the following:

    1) The sender MUST set CHANGEOVER_ACTIVE to indicate that a
       changeover has occurred.

    2) The sender MUST store the next TSN to be sent in
       next_tsn_at_change.


    On receipt of a SACK the sender SHOULD execute the following statements:

    1) If the cumulative ack in the SACK passes next_tsn_at_change, the
       CHANGEOVER_ACTIVE flag SHOULD be cleared.

    2) If the SACK contains gap acks and the flag CHANGEOVER_ACTIVE
       is set, then the receiver of the SACK MUST take the following
       actions: 

       A) Initialize cacc_saw_newack to 0 for all destination
          addresses.

       B) For each TSN t being acked that has not been acked in any
          SACK so far, set cacc_saw_newack to 1 for the destination that
          the TSN was sent to.

Iyengar et al.                                                  [Page 5]

draft-iyengar-sctp-cacc-03.txt                             November 2005


       C) Of the TSNs being newly acked, set highest_tsn_in_sack_for_dest to
          the highest TSN being newly acked for the respective destinations.

    3) If the CHANGEOVER_ACTIVE flag is set, then the sender MUST execute
       steps C and D to determine if the missing report count for TSN t
       SHOULD be incremented. Let d be the destination to which t was
       sent.

       C) If cacc_saw_newack is 0 for destination d, then the sender MUST
          NOT increment missing report count for t.

       D) If cacc_saw_newack is 1 for destination d, and if
          highest_tsn_in_sack_for_dest for destination d greater than t
          then the sender SHOULD increment missing report count for t
          (according to [RFC2960] and [RA+05]).

          NOTE: The HTNA algorithm does not need to be applied separately,
          since step 3.D above covers the functionality of the HTNA algorithm.


    3.3 Discussion

    The SFR-CACC algorithm maintains state information during a
    changeover, and uses this information to avoid incorrect fast
    retransmissions.  Consequently, this algorithm prevents the
    TCP-unfriendly cwnd growth. This algorithm has the added advantage
    that no extra bits are added to any packets, and thus the load on the
    wire and the network is not increased. SFR-CACC is also capable of
    handling multiple changeovers. One disadvantage of SFR-CACC is that
    there is added complexity at the sender to maintain and use the added
    state variables. Some of the TSNs on the old primary may also not be
    eligible for Fast Retransmit. To quantify the number of TSNs which
    will be ineligible for Fast Retransmit in the face of loss, let us
    assume that only one changeover is performed, and that SACKs are not
    lost. Under these assumptions, potentially only the last four packets
    sent to the old primary destination will be forced to be retransmitted
    with an RTO instead of a Fast Retransmit. In other words, under the
    stated assumptions, if a TSN that is lost has at least four packets
    successfully transmitted after it to the same destination, then the
    TSN will be retransmitted via Fast Retransmit.


4. Conclusion
    
    The general consensus at the IETF has been to dissuade the usage of
    SCTP's multihoming feature for simultaneous data transfer to the
    multiple destination addresses, largely due to insufficient research
    in the area. Though there is some amount of simultaneous data transfer
    in the described scenario, this phenomenon is an effect of changing
    the primary destination; not necessarily a result of an application
    intending to simultaneously transfer data over the multiple paths.
    Among other reasons, this changeover could be initiated by an
    application searching for a better path to the peer host for a long

    session, or attempting to perform a smoother failover.

    We recommend the addition of SFR-CACC to SCTP [RFC2960] to alleviate
    the problem of TCP-unfriendly cwnd growth and unnecessary fast
    retransmissions during a changeover. We have implemented the SFR-CACC
    algorithm in the NetBSD/FreeBSD release for the KAME stack
    [WEB_KAME]. The implementation uses three additional flags and
    one TSN marker per-destination, as described in section
    3.2. Approximately twenty lines of C code were needed to facilitate
    SFR-CACC, most of which will be executed only when a changeover is
    performed in an association.


5. Security Considerations
