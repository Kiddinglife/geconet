Internet-Draft      SCTP NAT Traversal Considerations      November 2007


1.  Conventions

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
   they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   It is the job of Network Address Translators (NAT) [RFC2663] and
   middleboxes [RFC3304] that utilize a NAT function to manipulate
   address and port information in the IP and transport header.  This
   poses a challenge for hosts that attempt to use certain end-to-end
   protocols [RFC3027].  This issue has drawn increasingly wide
   attention from the IP development and service community and much work
   has been done to ameliorate the situation for UDP, TCP and other
   protocols.

   The same issue not only exists for SCTP [RFC4960], but also may
   become a more difficult issue when SCTP associations are multi-homed.
   This document defines and classifies scenarios dealing with SCTP and
   NAT traversal.  In the following discussion, we will simply refer to
   NAT as a function, but note that many types of middleboxes employ NAT
   functions.


3.  SCTP NAT Traversal Scenarios

3.1.  Single Point Traversal

   In this case, all packets in the SCTP association go through a single
   NAT, as shown below:

      +---------+                           +---------+
      |  SCTP   |          +-----+          |  SCTP   |
      |end point|==========| NAT |==========|end point|
      |    A    |          +-----+          |    B    |
      +---------+                           +---------+

   A variation of this case is shown below, i.e., multiple NATs in a
   single path:

      +---------+                           +---------+
      |  SCTP   |    +-----+     +-----+    |  SCTP   |
      |end point|====| NAT |=::==| NAT |====|end point|
      |    A    |    +-----+     +-----+    |    B    |
      +---------+                           +---------+

   The two SCTP endpoints in this case can be either single-homed or
   multi-homed.  However, the important thing is that the NAT (or NATs)
   in this case sees ALL the packets of the SCTP association.

   In this single traverse point scenario, we must acknowledge that
   while one of the main benefits of SCTP multi-homing is redundant
   paths, the NAT function represents a single point of failure in the
   path of the SCTP multi-home association.  However, the rest of the
   path may still benefit from path diversity provided by SCTP multi-
   homing.

3.2.  Multi Point Traversal

   This case involves multiple NATs and each NAT only sees some of the
   packets in the SCTP association.  An example is shown below:

                      +------+
    +---------+  /====|NAT A |====\  +---------+
    |  SCTP   | /     +------+     \ |  SCTP   |
    |end point|/       ...          \|end point|
    |    A    |\                    /|    B    |
    +---------+ \     +------+     / +---------+
                 \====|NAT B |====/
                      +------+

   This case does NOT apply to a singly-homed SCTP association (i.e.,
   BOTH endpoints in the association use only one IP address).  The
   advantage here is that the existance of multiple NAT traverse points
   can preserve the path diversity of a multi-homed association for the
   entire path.  This in turn can improve the robustness of the
   communication.

   To make this work, however, all the NATs involved must recognize the
   packets they see as belonging to the same SCTP association and
   perform address translation in a consistent way.  It may be required
   that a pre-defined table of ports and addresses would be shared
   between the NAT's.  Other external management schemes that help
   multiple NAT's coordinate a multi-homed SCTP association could be
   investigated.


4.  Considerations for SCTP NAT Traversal

   In any type of traverse, the NAT must understand the SCTP protocol.
   Since SCTP is relatively new (compared to UDP or TCP), some older
   existing NATs that are capable of handling UDP or TCP traverse will
   need to be enhanced for SCTP.  In this section we discuss what
   considerations should be made for that NAT enhancement.

Internet-Draft      SCTP NAT Traversal Considerations      November 2007


   In a single-homed SCTP association, each endpoint uses only one IP
   address and the association will always go through a single NAT
   traverse point.  It is important that the endpoints do not list the
   IP-address again within the INIT or INIT-ACK chunks when setting up
   the association.  This makes sure that the NAT engine is not required
   to change the INIT or INIT-ACK chunk when modifying the IP-addresses
   of the packets containing the INIT and INIT-ACK chunks.

   It is also important that the checksum of the whole SCTP packet has
   to be recalculated if a part of the SCTP packet, for example port
   numbers or IP-addresses listed in the INIT or INIT-ACK chunk, is
   modyfied.  It is not possible for the SCTP checksum to calculate the
   difference of the checksum based only on the difference of the
   packets like it is possible for the checksum used for TCP or UDP.


5.  Security Considerations

   See [RFC4960] on SCTP security considerations.
